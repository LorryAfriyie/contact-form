### Useful resources

- [Vanilla JavaScript form validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzrHNx9WTFQ&t=1015s) - This YouTube video went through the process of being able to validate a form using vanilla JavaScript. This helped me with challenge, with the JavaScript solution that was presented, I had to tailor the code to suit a React.js solution.

- [Custom radio button](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSF0bXFUFGM&t=39s) - This YouTube video goes through the steps to be able to create a custom radio button, this video inspired the process of styling the radio buttons based on the challenge's requirement.
